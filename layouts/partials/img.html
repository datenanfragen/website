the `page` parameter.

        An explanation of the sizes and breakpoints used:

        * On a regular, full desktop layout, the image width will be constrained by the .narrow-page class. In this
          scenario, images cannot be wider than 784px, so we use that as the default fallback.
        * If we now start shrinking the page, the image width will also decrease accordingly. This will be handled by
          the following cases. *However*, as soon as we have a viewport width < 980px (which is the $max-width defined
          in variables.scss), we switch to the mobile layout. For a short while (until we reach a viewport width of
          781px), this actually allows the image to be *wider* than on the full desktop layout, reaching a width maximum
          of 881px. Thus, we provide a special breakpoint for this case to not risk blurry images.
        * Now, it becomes a question of weighing how many more breakpoints we want to support given the overhead. I
          decided to only support the default breakpoints in the Chromium DevTools (768px, 425px, and 320px).
