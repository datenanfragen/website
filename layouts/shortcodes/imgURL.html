<!--
Get the URL for an image resource (an image in the `content` directory), optionally resizing the image.

Use it like this: `{.{< imgURL name="[name]" command="[command]" options="[options]" >}}` (remove the `.`), where:
    - `[name]` is the name of the image
    - `[command]` is one of: `Fit`, `Resize` or `Fill`
    - `[options]` are the options for the processing, mainly the dimensions. Some other options are also supported, see:
        https://gohugo.io/content-management/image-processing/#image-processing-options

Only `[name]` is required, you can also not modify the image. However, if a `[command]` is specified, `[options]` also
need to be specified.

Examples (remove the `.`):
    - `{.{< imgURL name="sunset" command="Resize" options="300x" >}}`
    - `{.{< imgURL name="beach" command="Fit" options="1280x720" >}}`
    - `{.{< imgURL name="flower" command="Fill" options="100x600 jpg q100" >}}`
    - `{.{< imgURL name="dog" />}}`
-->
