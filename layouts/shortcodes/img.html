<!--
Insert an image, either from a named page resource or a URL.
If the image is given via the `name` instead of the `url`, the image is automatically made responsive for use in blog
posts and other content pages.

Use it like this (remove the `.`):
    `{.{< img name="[name]" â€¦ >}}`

With the following parameters:
    - `[name]`: The name of the image resource to insert. If this is specified, `[url]` cannot be used.
    - `[url]`: The URL of the image to insert. If this is specified, `[name]` cannot be used.
    - `[class]`: A CSS class to apply to the enclosing `<figure>`.
    - `[alt]`: The text to set for the `alt` and `title` attributes of the image. Falls back to `[caption]` if not set.
    - `[caption]`: The caption to display underneath the image.
    - `[link]`: The URL that the image links to.

Only either `[name]` or `[url]` are required, all other commands are optional.

For a description of the `[name]` parameter, see the documentation for the `imgURL` shortcode.
