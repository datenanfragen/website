The GDPR, like any other legal issue, can seem confusing at first glance. It introduces numerous legal concepts that are important for understanding the regulations.

What is a responsible person and how does he differ from the processor? And which of the two do I have to contact if I want to assert my rights against a company?

In order to keep the overview and to take advantage of your privacy rights, we explain in this article the most important terms and concepts around the GDPR. You'll notice: It's not that hard when you're a little bit on the subject.

## What is the GDPR?

The GDPR (short for General Data Protection Regulation) is an EU Regulation that came into force on 25 May 2018 and regulates data protection in the European Union. It aims to give citizens better control over their data and to harmonize the legal situation across the EU.

As an EU regulation, the GDPR does not have to be implemented by the member states, but is directly applicable law. In doing so, it largely replaces the previous national data protection law, such as the German BDSG (Federal Data Protection Act). However, individual aspects may also be individually designed by the member states, which is why the BDSG (new) has existed in Germany ever since.

## Terms and Concepts

### Supervisory Authority

The [Data Protection Supervisors] ({{<ref> supervisory-authorities ">}}) are independent bodies in each EU country whose job it is to ensure compliance with data protection laws, in particular, of course, the GDPR.

For this they may control those [responsible](#Responsible), if necessary, to comply with the data protection laws and, if necessary, even impose fines.  
As a consumer, you stand by as an uncomplicated help: If you think that a person responsible does not process your data correctly, you can turn to the data protection supervisory authorities for free at any time.

If you are not sure which authority to contact, look at our [Privacy Inspector Finder] ({{<ref "supervisory-authorities>}} # finder).

### Order processors

A processor, as the name implies, is a company that processes personal data on behalf of a [responsible](#Responsible) person. For example, if a company has its e-mail server operated by an external hoster, it will act as a processor.

Responsible and processor conclude a so-called "contract data processing contract" (ADV contract), which is to regulate exactly how the data is processed.  
Important for you as a consumer: As a rule, the processor is not the contact person if you want to exercise your [rights](#Rights). Instead, contact the person in charge directly.

### Special categories of personal data

Some data is more sensitive than other. So maybe you have no problem with giving your name to a new app - but you do not necessarily know your religious views. The GDPR recognizes that these so-called "special categories of personal data" deserve and need special protection. Therefore, the [processing of](#Processing) such data is allowed only under specific circumstances.

Specifically, this involves the following data:

* racial and ethnic origin
* political opinions
* religious or ideological beliefs
* Union affiliation
* genetic data
* Biometric data to uniquely identify a natural person
* Health data
* Sexual or sexual orientation data

### Affected person

The person concerned (rarely also "data subject") is the person whose [personal data](#PersonalData) are [processed](#Processing). As a consumer, that's usually you.

### Data minimization

Data minimization (or data minimization) is an important concept for data protection, which is also prescribed by the GDPR. The idea behind it is simple: only the data should be collected and [processed](#Processing), which are actually necessary for the respective purpose. If a company wants to send you a newsletter, it really only needs your e-mail address. In the sense of data minimization, it should then no longer collect data.

This concept is important not least for safety reasons. We live in a time when private data from users regularly gets to the public, because companies have not adequately secured these. Data that a company does not have can not be lost.

### Data Protection Officer

A data protection officer has the task of ensuring that a company (or other organization, eg a public authority) adheres to data protection law. He is appointed by the company himself and must have some independence in order to perform his task.

If a [person in charge](#Responsible) has appointed a data protection officer, this person should be your contact for data protection-related inquiries, for example if you want to exercise your [rights](#Rights).

### One-Stop Shop Principle

The [One-Stop-Shop-Principle] ({{<ref> supervisory-authorities "}}} # one-stop-shop) regulates the competence of the [data protection supervisory authorities](#SupervisoryAuthority). For you as a consumer that means concretely that you can also submit complaints to the supervisory authority at your place of residence or workplace, which is particularly helpful if the [responsible](#Responsible) person you are complaining about sits in another country.

To help you find the regulatory authority that supports you, our [Data Protection Supervisor Finder] ({{<ref "supervisory-authorities>}} # finder) can help.

### Personal Data

The concept of personal data is at the heart of the GDPR. Almost all regulations refer to it. As soon as an information can be assigned to a specific person, it is a personal date. A name is not necessarily required for the assignment, it is also sufficient for example B. an IP address, a user name, a cookie ID, or an ID number.

The information that the IP address 31.41.59.26 called our [generator] ({{<ref 'generator ">}} on May 25, 2018) would therefore be personal, for example. The information that in a bakery on the same day, one third of the customers paid in cash, however, not.

### Profiling

Profiling is a form of automated decision-making in which the [responsible](#Responsible) person uses your [personal data](#PersonalData) to automatically evaluate certain personal aspects of yourself without human intervention. Often, it's about analyzing and predicting things like the following about you:

* Work performance
* Economic Situation
* Health
* Personal Preferences
* Interests
* Reliability
* Behavior
* Place of Residence or Change of Location

A classic example is the conclusion of credit or mobile contracts. Many companies will submit your details to a credit agency such as the [Schufa] ({{<ref "schufa">}}), [Creditreform Boniversum] ({{<ref "creditreform-boniversum">}}) or [infoscore ] ({{<ref "infoscore">}}), which then uses certain aspects (such as your previous payment history or the number of your bank accounts) to tell you how likely you would be to meet your contractual obligations.

### Rights

The GDPR grants you extensive rights in relation to your [personal data](#PersonalData). That starts with the right to information: If a [responsible](#Responsible) person wants to [process](#Processing) your data, he / she must inform you about it and tell you how to reach him / her in case of questions.

Even after the processing of your data has begun, you have many more rights. For example, you may ask which personal data is processed for you and request a copy of it, request the correction of incorrect data and, in certain circumstances, even have your data deleted.

You can find a comprehensive overview and an exact explanation of this topic in our [article to your GDPR rights] ({{<ref "your-gdpr-rights">}}).

### Responsible

The person in charge is the body that runs the [processing](#Processing) of [personal data](#PersonalData) itself or has it performed by a [processor](#Processing). The term "processor" is here very broad, it may be for example a human, a company, an agency or an organization.

### Processing

As a processing GDPR describes virtually everything that a [responsible person](#Responsible) in charge can do with [personal data](#PersonalData). These include in particular:

* the elevation
* capturing
* organizing and organizing
* the storage
* the adaptation or change
* reading or queries
* the usage
* the disclosure
* matching or linking
* the restriction
* the deletion or annihilation

The term refers to both automated and manual processes.
