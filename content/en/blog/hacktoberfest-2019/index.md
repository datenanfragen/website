The hosting provider DigitalOcean is once again hosting the [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) to celebrate open source. The Hacktoberfest invites you to submit pull requests to open source projects. People who submit four or more pull requests, get a free t-shirt from DigitalOcean.

In addition to this official event, every year many other companies and organizations also use the opportunity to participate in the Hacktoberfest and offer additional rewards for certain contributions.  
Over here at datarequests.org, we [love open source]({{< ref "/open-source" >}}). Our project has been designed from the ground up to be as open as possible. We are thus very happy to announce that we are participating in the Hacktoberfest this year! We will reward contributions to our project that are made during October 2019 as a pull request through [GitHub](https://github.com/) with an exclusive sticker pack.

## What are the rewards?

The first 100 participants who submit at least one pull request that is accepted to one of the [qualifying repositories](#repos) between October 1, 2019 and November 1, 2019, will get an exclusive sticker pack from us for free.

In addition, we are will award t-shirts for the 10 contributions we like most. These winners will be selected by the Datenanfragen.de e.&nbsp;V. board after the event is over.

Participating is completely free for you, we will even pay for shipping the rewards internationally.

## Which repositories qualify?

<img class="offset-image offset-image-right" src="/card-icons/code.svg" style="height: 150px; margin-right: -100px; margin-top: -50px;">

We will count pull requests to all repositories in the [datenanfragen organization on GitHub](https://github.com/datenanfragen) as well as those to our repositories listed on our [open source page]({{< ref "/open-source" >}}).  
If you think your contribution to another repository will also help our project, please shoot us an email at [hacktoberfest@datenanfragen.de](mailto:hacktoberfest@datenanfragen.de) to ask if we can count that.

There are many areas where you can contribute—regardless of your previous experience with programming and data protection. To make it easier for you, we have collected a few suggestions for you:

* **Maintaining the company database**  
  Our [company database]({{< ref "/company" >}}) contains the contact details for privacy-related requests to lots of companies and other organisations. If you find a company that is missing or where the details are outdated, you can submit a pull request for that.  
  Feel free to use our [company JSON generator](https://company-json.netlify.com/). Also have a look at our [database notes](https://github.com/datenanfragen/data#data-format-guidelines-and-resources-for-company-records).  
  Please note that we can only count contributions made through the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/datenanfragen/data). We cannot count contributions made through our website.

* **Translating the request templates to more languages**  
  We would love to support other languages than English and German in the future. To do so, we first need to translate our request templates. Learn more in the [corresponding GitHub issue](https://github.com/datenanfragen/data/issues/229).

* **Listing suggested companies for more countries**  
  The request wizard on our homepage suggests—depending on the country—a list of companies that users should definitely send requests to. We would like to offer those lists for more countries. Learn more in the [corresponding GitHub issue](https://github.com/datenanfragen/data/issues/230).

* **Writing content**  
  We are also offering comprehensive posts about all topics relating to privacy and data protection. That includes things like explanations on an individuals rights under the GDPR and how to use them, comments on current news about data protection and tutorials on how to use the download features offered by some websites, among others.  
  We will gladly take new posts. Please submit them to the [website repository](https://github.com/datenanfragen/website).

* **Helping with the code**  
  The core of the project is of course the [website](https://github.com/datenanfragen/website). You have a feature you want to implement or a bug you want to fix? We are looking forward to your contribution!  
  If you need some inspiration, we have collected [some issues over at GitHub](https://github.com/datenanfragen/website/issues).

## Questions?

If you have any questions, feel free to drop us an email at [hacktoberfest@datenanfragen.de](mailto:hacktoberfest@datenanfragen.de) or leave a comment here. We will also gladly help you with any problems or if you're having trouble finding your way through the repositories. The best platform for that is comment in the corresponding issue.
