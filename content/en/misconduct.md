If you are subject to, or witness of, unacceptable behaviour as per our {{< link slug="/verein/code-of-conduct" text="code of conduct" >}}, or have any other concerns, please email <conduct@datenanfragen.de> ([PGP key](/pgp/4FF2F0D9.asc) `6638 17E7 7D01 8B53 7E08  6928 2E16 9F53 4FF2 F0D9`) or submit an encrypted report via the [web form](#form-for-reports) (anonymous reports are possible this way).

We will handle all reports with discretion and will inform you before we take action if you would like to. 

Your report will be handled by our person(s) appointed for anti-harassment by the general assembly, currently: Lorenz Sieben (chairperson)

In your report, please do your best to include: 

- Your contact information (unless you wish to report anonymously) 
- Identifying information (e.g. names, nicknames, pseudonyms) of the participant who has violated the code of conduct 
- The behaviour that was in violation 
- The approximate time of the behaviour 
- If possible, where the code of conduct violation happened 
- The circumstances surrounding the incident 
- Other people involved in the incident 
- If you believe the incident is ongoing, please let us know!
- If there is a publicly available record (e.g. mailing list record), please include a link 
- Any additional helpful information 

We will take all reports seriously, look into them, follow up with the reporter/harassed party whether action should be taken (unless it is an anonymous report), and we decide what action to take. We are no law enforcement and will not do a complete investigation or collection of evidence. Rather, we want to make sure that everyone, especially marginalized people, are safe within the community and will take immediate action accordingly.
