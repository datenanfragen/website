In our [investigation on Honey]({{< ref "blog/honey-data-collection" >}}), we have shown that the browser extension collects their users' data on a large scale. Regardless of whether an account has been registered or not, the add-on dilligently logs page views on plenty of websites and sends them to the company behind the extension, [Honey Science LLC]({{< ref "company/joinhoney" >}}), a US company that was recently [bought by PayPal](https://help.joinhoney.com/article/302-what-does-honey-joining-paypal-mean-for-members).

## How can I request my data?

Did you use Honey and maybe weren't aware of this data hoarding? Or do you simply want to know what Honey has saved about you? The GDPR grants you a number of [rights regarding your personal data]({{< ref "your-gdpr-rights" >}}), including the right to request a free copy of all data a company has collected <!-- stored? --> about you, the [**right of data access**]({{< ref "your-gdpr-rights#right-of-data-access">}}).

We can help you with that. We are a registered non-profit from Germany that stands up [for your right of data protection]({{< ref "verein/mission-statement" >}}).
We have already prepared the necessary request that you can use to demand a copy of your data from Honey Science LLC, the US-based company behind the browser extension. There are two forms on this page: Use the first one if you have used Honey with an account or the second one if you have used it [without an account](#used-Honey-without-an-account).

Afterwards, you can send the email using your own email program or webmailer. This way, everything you type into this page can be processed **locally on your device**. That means we will never see your data.

Honey Science LLC has a month to answer your request after you sent the email. They can extend that deadline by another two months if they have good reasons, but they have to tell you that within a month. If you decide that Honey shouldn't keep your data after receiving their response you can use your [**right to be forgotten**]({{< ref "your-gdpr-rights#right-to-be-forgotten" >}}) and make a request to demand the immediate deletion of your data. You can use our [generator]({{<ref "generator#!company=joinhoney">}}) <!-- TODO: set request type to DELETE when the generator supports this--> for that as well.

## Used Honey with an account?

You only have to enter your name, email and "Honey Gold" balance and you can already send your request via email‚Äîfree of charge of course.

You can view your Honey Gold balance [here](https://www.joinhoney.com/honeygold/overview).

<div id="act-with-account" class="act-widget" style="max-width: 600px; margin: auto;"></div>

## Used Honey without an account?

You've used Honey without creating an account? They have still collected your history data. To request it, you have to identify yourself with two IDs that Honey keeps on you.

Enter your name, email, and both IDs into the form below and you are ready to send your data request!

### Find your two IDs

Finding the two IDs (*userId* and *deviceId*) is unfortunately a little complicated, but it shouldn't be too hard if you follow this guide.

We have to look into the so-called "local storage" of the Honey extension. That is a place in your browser where pages and extensions can save data. You might have heard of cookies, local storage is similar.
The process for accessing Honey's local storage is different from browser to browser, so we have written two guides: One for Firefox and one for Chrome.
