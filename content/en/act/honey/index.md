In our {{< link slug="blog/honey-data-collection" text="investigation on Honey" >}}, we have shown that the browser extension collects their users' data on a large scale. Regardless of whether an account has been registered or not, the add-on diligently logs page views on plenty of websites and sends them to the company behind the extension, {{< link slug="company/joinhoney" text="Honey Science LLC" >}}, a US company that was [bought by PayPal](https://help.joinhoney.com/article/302-what-does-honey-joining-paypal-mean-for-members).

{{< featuredImg alt="Photo of a lot of bees that rush to a drop of sugar water, above that the text: ‚ÄúHoney, the data hoarder‚Äîrequest your data now‚Äù" >}}

## What should I do?

Did you use Honey and maybe weren't aware of this data hoarding? Or do you simply want to know what Honey has saved about you? The GDPR grants you a number of {{< link slug="your-gdpr-rights" text="rights regarding your personal data" >}}, including the right to request a free copy of all data a company has collected <!-- stored? --> about you, the {{< link slug="your-gdpr-rights#right-of-data-access" text="**right of data access**" >}}.

If you feel Honey violated your rights after inspecting the data they have stored on you and you want to file a complaint with the data protection authorities, you can use the template at the end of this article.

## How can I request my data?

We have already prepared the necessary request that you can use to demand a copy of your data from Honey Science LLC, the US-based company behind the browser extension. There are two forms on this page: Use the first one if you have used Honey with an account or the second one if you have used it [without an account](#used-Honey-without-an-account).

Afterwards, you can send the email using your own email program or webmailer. This way, everything you type into this page can be processed **locally on your device**. That means we will never see your data.

Honey Science LLC has a month to answer your request after you sent the email. They can extend that deadline by another two months if they have good reasons, but they have to tell you that within a month. If you decide that Honey shouldn't keep your data after receiving their response you can use your {{< link slug="your-gdpr-rights#right-to-be-forgotten" text="**right to be forgotten**" >}} and make a request to demand the immediate deletion of your data. You can use our {{< link slug="generator#!company=joinhoney" text="generator" >}} <!-- TODO: set request type to DELETE when the generator supports this--> for that as well.

## Used Honey with an account?

You only have to enter your name, email and "Honey Gold" balance and you can already send your request via email‚Äîfree of charge of course.

You can view your Honey Gold balance [here](https://www.joinhoney.com/honeygold/overview).

{{< noScript "noscript-actwidget" >}}

## Used Honey without an account?

You've used Honey without creating an account? They have still collected your history data. To request it, you have to identify yourself with two IDs that Honey keeps on you.

Enter your name, email, and both IDs into the form below and you are ready to send your data request!

### Find your two IDs

Finding the two IDs (*userId* and *deviceId*) is unfortunately a little complicated, but it shouldn't be too hard if you follow this guide.

We have to look into the so-called "local storage" of the Honey extension. That is a place in your browser where pages and extensions can save data. You might have heard of cookies, local storage is similar.
The process for accessing Honey's local storage is different from browser to browser, so we have written two guides: One for Firefox and one for Chrome.

## How can I file a complaint about this?

The GDPR gives you the right to file a complaint against a company with the {{< link slug="supervisory-authorities" text="supervisory authorities" >}}.
Filing a complaint is free.
Your complaint should describe, if applicable, that you requested your data from Honey and that you think, after you've read their response, that they have violated your privacy rights. You might illustrate that with examples from Honey's data export.

The responsible authority will check your complaint and if they determine a misconduct on Honey's side they might instruct them to cease that activity or even impose a fine.

The authorities need some time to process your complaint, especially if the company is in another country than you.

You can use this tool to find the authority responsible for you: 

<div class="sva-finder"></div>
{{< noScript "noscript-sva" >}}
<script>
    window.props = { override: { country: { de: 'debralda' } } };
    window.addEventListener('load', function() { renderSvaFinder(); });
</script>

We also prepared a complaint template for you to use. Modify it according to your situation: Fill in the curly brackets, check if the parts in square brackets are suitable. Don't forgot to include the referenced ATTACHMENT.
