In order for you to be able to trust us, we pledged to be as transparent as possible about our procedures, finances and decisions. Because of that, we have joined the [Initiative for a Transparent Civil Society](https://www.transparency.de/mitmachen/initiative-transparente-zivilgesellschaft/), an initiative by the German branch of Transparency International, which is allowed to audit us on a sample basis. They ensure that we will keep our promise of transparent management. On this page we summarized all the important information that we publish as part of that.
