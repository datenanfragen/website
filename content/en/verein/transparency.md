In order for you to be able to trust us, we pledged to be as transparent as possible about our procedures, finances and decisions. Because of that, we have joined the [Initiative for a Transparent Civil Society](https://www.transparency.de/mitmachen/initiative-transparente-zivilgesellschaft/), an initiative by the German branch of Transparency International, which is allowed to audit us on a sample basis. They ensure that we will keep our promise of transparent management. On this page we summarized all the important information that we publish as part of that.

The following sections go beyond the ten pieces of information required by the Initiative for a Transparent Civil Society. We believe it is important to be transparent on these points as well.

## 11. Compensated lectures

Our {{< link slug="verein/board" text="board members" >}} work on a strictly voluntary basis and receive no payment from the association for their work. In some cases, however, members of the association can receive compensation from external organizations for lectures on topics that concern the association. Of course, no funds of the association are used for such compensated lectures, they are the private responsibility of the respective members.

The board has to publicly document lectures here for which board members have received compensation from external organizations.

### 2020

* In March 2020, the Humboldt University of Berlin invited Benjamin Altpeter and Lorenz Sieben to give a [seminar on Datenanfragen.de](https://www.datenanfragen.de/verein/event/hlci-berlin-2020/) (post in German) as a guest lecture at the [HLCI](http://www.hlci.de/). The Humboldt University has covered the train travel and accommodation costs and paid them a compensation of 250&nbsp;€ each. Benni and Lorenz voluntarily decided to donate half of the compensation to the association.
