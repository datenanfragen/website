We are a non-profit that stands up for the fundamental right to data protection and privacy. We want every person to be able to decide for themselves, who knows how much about them, and that authorities and companies which try to snatch that information will be held accountable. We stand up for transparency, openness, collaboration and solidarity with the affected. In doing so, we take the side of the consumer and citizen, whose rights we defend.

These goals are expressed in the purposes defined in our [constitution]({{< ref "verein/constitution" >}}). We want to explain here once again, how exactly our goals are laid out and how we are planning to achieve them.

## Make rights known

Our goal is to inform as many people as possible that they have a fundamental right to privacy and data protection and that they can demand it. For that, we offer educational material on our website and in print, create class and school material, join events and run campaigns. Especially important to us currently is to educate people about the rights they gain with the GDPR.
 
## Make rights accessible

Not only do we want people to know about their right to manage their own data, we also want them to use it to prevent their rights from wearing out. Because of that, we make our content easily accessible and understandable and offer tools like the generator and the database to make it easier to fight for your own rights.
 
## Fight for new rights

In a democracy, it is always important to stand up for your own interests and to fight for them jointly with others. Therefore, we join the discussion on new privacy laws and offer suggestions on how to improve on them in the future. It is worrying that we pay with our data everywhere on the internet and that the state and the companies want to know more and more about us, so we need to go against this for the future.
 
## Be an example 

We don't just want to criticize the existing conditions, but also want to show that it can be done differently. In order to do so, we design our own programs and processes in a way so that they use the minimal amount of data without it being annoying. While doing so, we are transparent and open, to allow for control and trust, but also for others to take us as an example and to improve their own processes.
