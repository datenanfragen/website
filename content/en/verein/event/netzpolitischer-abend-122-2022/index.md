We gave a short presentation at the 122. Netzpolitischer Abend by Digitale Gesellschaft at the c-base. In this talk, we presented our project and our work so far. We talked about the rights from the GDPR and how these can be exercised through our website. We also presented our new features for generating admonitions and complaints for incorrectly answered requests and reported on our research into data protection violations by companies, for example with regards to tracking in mobile apps.
