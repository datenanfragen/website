}

Regardless of whether you are already contributing to datarequests.org, whether you are interested in joining, or you just want to get to know us: Our contributor meetup is supposed to be a space to ask question on contributing, for learning on how you can participate, and where data protection nerds can network on various issues. To take part, you need nothing in particular. Just be in our online meeting on November 7 at 17:00 (CEST) and bring your curiosity, questions and motivation.

If you know that you will definitely come, we would appreciate a message to kontakt@datenanfragen.de for our planning.
