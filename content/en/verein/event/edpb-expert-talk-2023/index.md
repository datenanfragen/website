We were invited to speak before the tech advisory board of the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) about our results and the tools we developed for mobile app tracking research. We held a presentation of what we found and presented our new libraries and tools. We also launched [trackers.tweasel.org](https://tracker.tweasel.org), our new tracking adapter database, in that meeting. The meeting was not open to the public.
