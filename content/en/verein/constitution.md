<div class="box box-info" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
Our constitution lays down the legal framework for the Datenanfragen.de e.&nbsp;V., the legal entity running this website. Among other things, it explains our purpose and how we want to achieve that, it sets the rules concerning membership in our non-profit and it defines the decision-making process. It also ensures that the activities of our non-profit stay privacy-focused, transparent and free. Only the general assembly is allowed to make changes to the constitution.

As we are based in Germany, only the <a href="{{< ref path="constitution.md" lang="de" >}}">German version</a> of our constitution is legally binding. This translation is only offered for convenience.<br>
In cases where we think the English translation may be ambiguous, we have referenced the original German text [in square brackets] for clarification.
