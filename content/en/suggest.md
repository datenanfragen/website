<summary>Tips for enthusiasts</summary>
If you want to get into the details of how we collect the data for our company database, you can read these tips.
Considering these tips when suggesting companies helps us a lot, but is <strong>completely optional</strong>. Whether you follow none of these tips, one, some, or all: We are happy about every suggestion!

- The first and best starting point for obtaining information about a company is the privacy policy. It also makes for a great `source`.
- We only allow personal data in our database if it's absolutely necessary. That means, we only accept e.g. <code>jane.doe@example.org</code> as the email if no generic privacy-related email like <code>privacy@example.org</code> exists.
- We prefer the contact details of a data protection officer over the regular contact details of a company.
    - c/o External Data Protection Officer Ltd.  
      Example road 1  
      12345 City  
      Germany  
- You can see our preferred address format above: Separate lines with line breaks, do not include the company name and add the country as the last line.
- If the company's email is obviously privacy related, e.g. `privacy@` or `gdpr@`, you can set `Suggested transport medium` to email.
- If you want to learn even more, you can check out our [`data` repository on GitHub](https://github.com/datenanfragen/data/).
