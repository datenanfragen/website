The GDPR grants you extensive rights with respect to your personal data. To make exercising these rights as easy as possible for you, we have prepared these sample letters.

With them, sending a GDPR request is simple: All you need to do is enter your data – we have provided everything else.

## Which kind of request do you want to send?

There's a letter template for each request type, of course. We support the most common ones.

## There is an easier way!

The sample letters above are a good start but we strongly believe there should be an even easier way to send GDPR requests.

That's why we have developed a [generator]({{< ref "/generator" >}}) that automatically generates such requests for you. All you need to do is select a company (we also have many companies in our database already, so you won't even need to find their contact details) and enter your details.

Give it a try!
