## General remarks

Thank you for your interest in our privacy policy. We are glad that you are interested in how we process your data.

We are committed to privacy, so we have designed our services from the ground up to collect as little data as possible. Most features on datarequests.org will be executed entirely on your own computer, so the data you enter will never even reach our servers. Furthermore, our websites can only be accessed via a TLS-encrypted connection to ensure that your connection to our server cannot be compromised by third parties.  
To exercise your privacy rights, we of course recommend using our [generator](https://www.datarequests.org/generator) which will help you generate the appropriate requests for free.

In this privacy policy, we would like to explain to you what data we collect and what rights you have.

### Scope

This privacy policy applies to the websites [Datenanfragen.de](https://www.datenanfragen.de) and [datarequests.org](https://www.datarequests.org). Please note that there is a [separate privacy policy](https://verein.datenanfragen.de/datenschutz) for the activites of the Datenanfragen.de e.&nbsp;V.

With datarequests.org, we want to help you exercise your right to privacy. In order to do so, we offer a generator that helps you automatically generate requests, a company database with contact data for privacy-related requests to many companies and educational material on subjects related to privacy and data protection.

### Do Not Track

We respect the [Do Not Track (DNT)](https://www.eff.org/issues/do-not-track) option that you can set in your browser. If you have enabled it, we will deactivate all telemetry (currently there is none but we may implement privacy-friendly telemetry in the future).

We also recommend that you install [Privacy Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger), a free and open source browser extension that sets the DNT header for you and automatically blocks websites that do not adhere to it.

### Profiling

We do not use profiling or any other type of automated decision making.

## Collected data

To operate our website and to provide our services, we collect and process some personal data. Our top priority is to minimise data collection and processing: We only collect personal data where it is necessary and only to the extent that it is necessary. In addition, data is always collected for a specific purpose and storage is limited to the necessary period of time.

In order to give you the greatest possible control over your privacy, you can set whether you want to activate many functions at any time via our [privacy controls](https://www.datarequests.org/privacy-controls). A cookie is stored in your browser for each option. It only contains an indication as to whether you have activated or deactivated the respective option, but no personal data.

In this section we would like to explain to you exactly under which circumstances we collect and process which data. Not listed here are the processings that take place exclusively on your own computer and for which no data is transferred to us. You can find further information about these in the above mentioned privacy controls.
