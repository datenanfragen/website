# Datenanfragen.de components for external use

> This package allows you to use the components making up Datenanfragen.de outside of the [`website`](https://github.com/datenanfragen/website) repository.

Datenanfragen.de is an open source project by [Datenanfragen.de e.&nbsp;V.](https://www.datarequests.org/verein), a registered non-profit from Germany. We have made it our mission to help you exercise your right to privacy. Through our website, we offer a generator for GDPR requests, among other things.

This package allows you to use the components making up that website elsewhere. We use this in our [mobile](https://github.com/datenanfragen/mobile-app/) and [desktop app](https://github.com/datenanfragen/desktop-app/).

## Setup

You can install the package using yarn or npm:

```sh
yarn add @datenanfragen/components
# or `npm i @datenanfragen/components`
```

First, you either need to call the exported `setupWindow()` function or do the setup in there yourself.

You also need the following HTML:

```html
<aside id=flash-messages></aside>
```

Finally, include the CSS:

```scss
@import 'npm:@datenanfragen/components/dist/index.css';
```

## Usage

Now, you can use the exported components in your Preact code, e.g.:

```tsx
import { render } from 'preact';
import { ActWidget } from '@datenanfragen/components';

const App = () => (
    <>
        <h1>Send a data request</h1>
        <ActWidget requestTypes={['access', 'erasure']} company="datenanfragen" transportMedium="email" />
    </>
);

const el = document.getElementById('app');
if (el) render(<App />, el);
```
