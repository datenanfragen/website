> This repository contains the source code for the Datenanfragen.de website.

Datenanfragen.de is an open source project by [Datenanfragen.de e.&nbsp;V.](https://www.datarequests.org/verein), a registered non-profit from Germany. We have made it our mission to help you exercise your right to privacy.

Live versions of the website are currently available in [German](https://www.datenanfragen.de), [English](https://www.datarequests.org), [French](https://www.demandetesdonnees.fr) and [Portuguese](https://www.pedidodedados.org).

## Development

Datenanfragen.de is designed as a static website, running on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Preact](https://preactjs.com/).

To build the project locally for development, follow these steps:

1. Install [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) and the extended(!) version of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/).
2. Clone the repo and run `yarn` in the root directory of the repo to fetch all required dependencies.
3. Run the deploy script (`./deploy.sh`) to fetch and prepare the required resources from our [data](https://github.com/datenanfragen/data) repository.
4. Open two terminal windows. In the first, run `yarn dev` to start the Webpack file watcher which will automatically build the JS files. In the second one, run `hugo server` to have Hugo continously build the actual website and the SCSS.
5. Now the website should be served by Hugo on multiple ports, starting from `1313`, for the different language versions.

The production builds are done automatically by [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) using the `deploy.sh` script and deployed using dattel, our own static hosting solution (split into a [server](https://github.com/binaro-xyz/dattel-server) and [client](https://github.com/binaro-xyz/dattel-client)).

For testing, we use CircleCI in combination with Cypress (see [more on our browser tests here](/cypress/README.md)). We previously used BrowserStack who kindly let us use their services.
