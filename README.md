# The Datenanfragen.de website

> This repository contains the source code for the Datenanfragen.de website.

Datenanfragen.de is an open source project by [Datenanfragen.de e.&nbsp;V.](https://www.datarequests.org/verein), a registered non-profit from Germany. We have made it our mission to help you exercise your right to privacy.  
Through our website, we offer a generator for GDPR requests as well as access to our company and supervisory authority database (see [this repository](https://github.com/datenanfragen/data/) for the source behind this data) and comprehensive articles on the GDPR and privacy in general.

Live versions of the website are currently available in [German](https://www.datenanfragen.de), [English](https://www.datarequests.org), [French](https://www.demandetesdonnees.fr) and [Portuguese](https://www.pedidodedados.org).

## Development

Datenanfragen.de is designed as a static website, running on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Preact](https://preactjs.com/).

To build the project, first install Hugo and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com). Then clone the repository and run `yarn` in the root directory to fetch all required dependencies. Then run the deploy script (`./deploy.sh`) to fetch the required resources from our data repository.  
For development, use `yarn dev` to start the webpack file watcher which will automatically build the JS and (S)CSS files. For Hugo, use `hugo server`.  
The production builds are automatically done by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) using the `deploy.sh` script.

For testing, we use CircleCI in combination with Cypress (see [more on our browser tests here](/cypress/README.md)). We previously used BrowserStack who kindly let us use their services.
